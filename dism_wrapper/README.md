This is a dism wrapper script to resolve the issue with SCCM OSD documented here:
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/system_center_configuration_manager_operating_system_deployment_support_blog/2016/12/28/apply-driver-package-task-fails-when-the-adk-is-upgrade-to-adk-10-1607/

- Compile dism_wrapper.au3 script to create AMD64 and x86 versions.
- Copy both compiled scripts and the dism_wrapper.cmd file into an SCCM package.
- Create and distribute SCCM package to DPs.
- Create run command line action in your task sequence.
  - Place this action just before your Apply Driver Package section of the task sequence.
  - Command line: dism_wrapper.cmd
  - Package: the new SCCM package created in step 3
  
That's it!  The cmd file will rename X:\Windows\System32\dism.exe to dism2.exe.  Then it copies in the appropriate compiled script as the new X:\Windows\System32\dism.exe.


The script itself flows something like this:
- Parses out the dism command line parameters that are passed.
- Gets the path to the drivers.xml file.
- Gets the driver path from the drivers.xml uses XMLDOM COM object
- Modifies the dism command line to use /Add-Driver /Driver:
- And most importantly adds a /Recurse to the command to resolve the issue documented in the blog post.
